   <p>The participants all found both websites to be easy to use. However, none of my survey
   partipants were avid candle buyers. Thus, the usability of the website was good, but none 
   of my participants were eager to use them for candle purchases (See Table 3 below).

<div><p>The participants found the Yankee Candle website to be slightly easier to use
than the Goose Creek Candle site. However, the participants did not gravitate towards
the products offered on Yankee Candles' website (See Table 4 below). None of my participants
wanted to return to the Yankee Candle site to make a purchase.
