<h3>Conclusion Section</h3> 
<body>
<p>From this study, I learned that most of my friends did not like 
candles. The participants were extremely familiar with computers and the internet. Many 
 participants regularly puchased items online. From a sample size of four, it is hard to 
 generalize using statistics. However, based on the reports on usability, both websites 
 were easy to use. Participants were already quite familiar with purchasing items online. 
 The usability studie focused on website design. The participants were trouble-shooting 
 common problems that users may have in finding the 
right item.</p>
