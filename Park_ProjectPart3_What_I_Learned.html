<h3>Conclusion Section</h3> 
<body>
<p><font color="purple">From this study, I learned that most of my friends did not like 
candles. The participants were extremely familiar with computers and internet usages. 
From a sample size of four, it is hard to generalize using statistics. However, based on
the reports on usability, both websites were easy to use. Participants were already 
quite familiar with purchasing items online. The usability studie focused on website design.
The participants were trouble-shooting common problems that users may have in finding the 
right item. </p>
