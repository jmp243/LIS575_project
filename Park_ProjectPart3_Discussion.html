<h3>Discussion Section</h3> 
<div><p>Candles were not the most popular items to purchase among my four
participants. Because my participants were all very familiar with computers, the Internet, 
and online purchases, they had no trouble using the Yankee Candle and Goose Creek Candle
websites. However, the interest in the products on either websites were lacking. </p>
<p>The respondents found the Yankee Candle and Goose Creek Candle websites easy to use. 
The one major difference between Yankee Candle and Goose Creek Candle was that the in 
order to remove an item from the shopping cart, the user could not press the minus button 
on Yankee Candle to change the quantity from 1 to 0. The user had to press a specific button
to remove the item. Goose Creek Candle website allowed users to change the quantity from 1 
to 0. The impression of usability was fairly high for both websites. None of the participants 
wanted to return to the Yankee Candle site, while some partipants considered using the 
Goose Creek Candle site. The Goose Creek Candle site also featured scented hand soaps, 
which are popular especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.
